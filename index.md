## About

Forecasting has been used to predict elections, climate change, and the spread of COVID-19. Poor forecasts led to the 2008 financial crisis. In our daily lives, good forecasting ability can help us plan our work, be on time to events, and make informed career decisions. This practically-oriented class will provide you with tools to make good forecasts, including Fermi estimates, calibration training, base rates, scope sensitivity, and power laws. We'll discuss several historical instances of successful and unsuccessful forecasts, and practice making forecasts about our own lives, about current events, and about scientific progress.

**Prerequisites**: Stat134 or a similar probability course (i.e. EECS126, STAT140, IEOR172).

## Lecture

MWF11-12, in Physics Building 251 

This class will be heavily disussion-based and participation will count towards the grade. Monday and Wednesday lectures 
will be a combination of traditional lecture and group activities, while most Fridays will be student-led small 
group discussions with instructors helping to facilitate.

Instead of exams, there will be a final project. Students in Stat260 will be expected to do a more substantial project.

There will be no official lab / discussion block, but some homework will involve programming.

 * Jacob Steinhardt (Lead Instructor): 325 Evans, Monday 10-11am
