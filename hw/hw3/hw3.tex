On Gradescope, for each of the \textbf{9 questions}, submit your estimates, reasoning and relative errors. Please also submit the time it took to complete this exercise.

\section*{Deliberate Practice: Estimation and Calibration}

\emph{Expected completion time: 45 minutes}

For each of the following questions, estimate an inclusive $80\%$ confidence interval for the answer without looking things up. For each quantity, we provided one link with a reasonable-seeming answer. We recommend spending around 5-10 minutes on each estimation question. You will be graded on your thinking process, not your accuracy.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How many employment-based Green Card applications did US Citizenship and Immigration Services process in 2021? Note that the question is about the number of applications \emph{processed}, not \emph{approved}. \href{https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-announces-fy-2021-accomplishments}{Link to Answer}
	\item How many acres of US land were burnt by wildfires in 2020? \href{https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IF10244.pdf}{Link to Answer}
	\item How many records have the Beatles sold, in terms of worldwide certified (not claimed) sales, as reported by Wikipedia? Records include singles and full-length albums. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_music_artists#250_million_or_more_records}{Link to Answer}

\end{enumerate}

On Gradescope, for each of the \textbf{5 questions}, submit your estimate and an explanation of your reasoning. Please also submit the time it took to complete this exercise.

\section*{Deliberate Practice: Reference Classes}

\emph{Expected completion time: 60 minutes}

For the following questions, describe 3 reference classes you would use to answer it, and what estimates they lead to. To do this, you can look up information about the reference classes, but not the answer itself. 

Once you have come up with the reference classes, look up the answer, and discuss which reference classes worked well, and which worked poorly. We recommend spending around 15 minutes on each question.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How much did the movie \emph{Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2} gross worldwide? \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_%E2%80%93_Part_2#Box_office}{Link to Answer}

\end{enumerate}

For each question, submit a mean and inclusive 80\% confidence interval (or a probabilities for questions 3 and 4), as well as an explanation of your reasoning (~1-2 paragraphs). \textbf{Please include a copy of your google form responses with your Gradescope submission.} On Gradescope, please also submit the time it took to complete this exercise.
