    "# Homework 4 Lab: Forecasting Points Per Game (PPG) in the NBA Part I\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using data scraped from https://www.basketball-reference.com/ to explore different forecasting strategies to predict who will have the highest PPG in the NBA in a particular week.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "We'll use data from the 2020-21 NBA season between December 2020 and March 2021 to forecast the highest PPG players in April 2021, the final month of the regular season. In this lab, we will focus on the approach of **reference class forecasting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part II in a future week will explore another approach. This lab has many open-ended questions, and there is often not one correct answer. We will grade submissions mostly based on your reasoning. "
