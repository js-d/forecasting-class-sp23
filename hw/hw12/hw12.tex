\section*{Predictions}

\emph{Expected completion time: 90 minutes}

Register the following predictions. You can submit them by going to \href{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GtTv93jJqtHLPuYAle5L9XQFdcTDxNm-hsitq9hiK4w/edit}{this URL} and following the form's instructions. For these predictions, (and all predictions about the future throughout this class), we encourage you to use external sources -- by googling things, reading news articles, talking to friends who follow politics or music stats, etc.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Will \href{https://www.zillow.com/b/studio,-%241,850-berkeley-ca-5YCBTB/}{this apartment} be claimed on Zillow by EOD April 30th? The question will resolve as yes if \href{https://www.zillow.com/b/studio,-%241,850-berkeley-ca-5YCBTB/}{this link} no longer leads to a Zillow page where it's possible to ``request a tour''. For ethical reasons, please do not reach out to the landlord.
	\item How many Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) will be released on April 30th, based on the Twitter account \href{https://twitter.com/CVEnew?ref_src=twsrc}{@CVEnew}? This question will resolve as the number of tweets from this account on April 30th that announce a vulnerability and link to \url{cve.mitre.org}.
	\item What will be the price of regular unleaded gas at the Shell (2200 Durant Ave, Berkeley, CA) on April 30th?
\end{enumerate}
For each question, submit an inclusive 80\% confidence interval or your probabilities, as well as an explanation of your reasoning (1-2 paragraphs).
\textbf{Please include a copy of your google form responses with your Gradescope submission.}
On Gradescope, please also submit the time it took to complete this exercise.
